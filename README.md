# Projectile_Motion_Simulator
In the simulator, the user can input values for the launch height, launch angle, initial velocity, and different gravitational forces, not limited to Earth, such as the Moon, Mars, and the Sun. More advanced options, such as the option to experiment with different mass values, and air drag were also added in this simulator.
